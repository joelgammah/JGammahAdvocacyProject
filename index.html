      <h2>About My Topic</h2>
      <p>Racial injustice refers to the unequal treatment and discrimination of individuals based on their race. In the United States, racial injustice has a long history, dating back to the country's founding and the institution of slavery. Even after the abolition of slavery, racial discrimination and segregation persisted, and continue to be a significant problem in the United States today.

    <h2>Impact!</h2>
    <p>In the United States, racial minorities generally refer to people who are not white. This includes people who identify as Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, and other non-white racial groups. While the term "minority" can be used to describe any group that is not in the majority, it is often used to refer to racial and ethnic groups that have historically been disadvantaged and still facing racial injustice.</p>

        <p>Black communities thrive when we invest in them. We're leading the charge to transform our communities from awarding $150,000+ in Black business grants to defending majority-Black Mason, TN and Jackson, MS from racist policies.

We will continue to advocate for environmental and climate justice, push for united resolutions and continue to strive to close the racial wealth gap once and for all. It is only with your dedicated support that we can continue to invest in us in 2023 and beyond.</p>
